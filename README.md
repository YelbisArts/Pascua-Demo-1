# Pascua-Demo-1
Website Build demonstrating simple, static HTML and CSS with floats.

This website is a direct clone to Shay Howe's styles conference website. This was created over several weeks through his HTML/CSS reading guide.
Building the website allowed me to practice solid fundamentals in web design as well as building fluency with HTML and CSS.
Notably, Shay Howe uses floats instead of grids or flexbox herem which builds on familiarity of older style designs that will be helpful when looking at sites that still use this archaic practice.
